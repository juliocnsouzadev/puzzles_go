## Dynamic Programming
_Dynamic programming is a technique used in computer programming to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. The solutions to the subproblems are stored in memory and reused as needed to solve larger problems. This approach can be more efficient than solving the larger problem directly, as it avoids redundant calculations and can lead to significant performance improvements. Dynamic programming is commonly used in optimization problems, such as finding the shortest path in a graph or the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in an array._

## Heap
### Min Heap
Min heaps are a type of binary heap data structure that adhere to a specific property known as the heap property. In the case of a min heap, the heap property is defined as follows: the key value of each node in the heap is greater than or equal to the key value of its parent node, with the minimum key value being in the root node.

This property means that, at any given node in the min heap, its key value (and the key value of all of its descendants) is always greater than or equal to the key value of its parent. Hence, at the top of the heap (which we call the root), we always have the smallest or minimum element in the heap. This is where the name "min heap" comes from.

Conceptually, you can imagine a min heap as a binary tree where each parent node is smaller or equal to its child nodes. If you were to traverse this tree from the root downwards, the value of the nodes would either stay the same or increase, never decrease.
