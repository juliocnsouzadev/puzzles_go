## Dynamic Programming
_Dynamic programming is a technique used in computer programming to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. The solutions to the subproblems are stored in memory and reused as needed to solve larger problems. This approach can be more efficient than solving the larger problem directly, as it avoids redundant calculations and can lead to significant performance improvements. Dynamic programming is commonly used in optimization problems, such as finding the shortest path in a graph or the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in an array._
